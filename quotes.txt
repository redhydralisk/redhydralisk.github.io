Don't expect logic.  Illogical things will happen.  No free will.  People ultimately have limited ability.  Do not get upset.

Be careful with what you say/think is right/best course of action.  You could be wrong.  You have been so many times before.

Humans are irrational.  They will do illogical things to justify the ends.  Examples: Eating animals who were likely tortured.  Networking teacher: he did the job for the money.  Trump supporters.

Why did god make women so pretty?  So men would love them.  Why did god make women so dumb?  So they would love men.

So many distractions nowadays.  Get a laser focus on your goals and necessary tasks to stay productive and make best use of your time.  Life is short.  Instead of multi-tasking, do single-tasking.  Those who fail to plan, plan to fail.

A lot of people in the replies here who apparently can't seem to understand that they're lucky they weren't born in, for example, a poor village in North Korea.

5 hinderances to self mastery.
1. Sensual desire (social media, games, click bait, side projects/hobbies, email (rasp pi projects,bug bounty), fixing small things in the house, links from Q/chat, self help videos, interesting videos/news) 
2. Ill will - dislike, object, situation, person.  (bumpy road, rain, swim river).  Let go of ill will.
3. Sloth - heaviness of body.  Dullness of the mind. Sleepiness.  Non motivation.
4. Restlessness - unsettled mind.  mind cannot settle in the present moment.  Worrying about the future or traveling in the past and rejecting/judging.  Monkey mind...contstantly jumping from one branch to another.  Cannot see clearly.
5. Skeptical doubt.  Indecisiveness - lost in thought.  What if questions.

How to deal with the Hinderances: Let it rain:
R-recognize.  Recognize the state of the mind.
A-accept.  And acknowledge and allow the situation/person to be how the way it is/how they are.
I-investigate emotional/mental state.  Why did it come up.  What is going to be the consequence.
N-non-identify.  I am not the body.  I am not the mind.  I am not my emotion.  It's that I can see all three aspects about me.  All of our lifetimes/lives are too unique to copy the past from someone else.  To bring meaning/value to your life, you need to learn and master yourself.  Don't let the hinderances to stop you.

Think of how far you are from the smart/wise people you know:
-Think hard about what you say/think/do.  There's a good chance it's wrong/not ideal.  But do your best.
-Be understanding of others who may seem to be not logical (like you).  Think of others who you're certain to have been patient with you.
-Think of homeless people who are able to look at the bright side to get them through.

Don't be surprised
Don't get angry - grasping hot coal with the intent to hurt someone else - you get burned. 
Be calm - Thich Nhat Hanh

You can't change someone else's behavior.  You can't make someone behave the way you want them to.  
Why should you have to change?  Because it's your heart attack. -Jay Johnson


“When we walk like (we are rushing), we print anxiety and sorrow on the earth. We have to walk in a way that we only print peace and serenity on the earth... Be aware of the contact between your feet and the earth. Walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet.”  - Thich Nhat Hanh
“When another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over. He does not need punishment; he needs help. That's the message he is sending.” ― Thich Nhat Hanh

Ruthless priortization - lots of good ideas.  have to say no to many of them to get to the great ideas.

Protect your time/attention.  Social media has AI to take your time/attention.  Step back and look at your life as an outside observer.

The highest level of mastery is simplicity.  Most information is irrelevant and most effort is wasted, but only the expert knws what to ignore.  James Clear

7 Skills worth learning-tech lead
1. Empathy for negotiation.  Label other's feelings to get them to say two magic words: That's right.  Have a shared feeling.

3. Marketing - everyone is clamoring for attention (now a highly valued currency).

4. Ownership mentality and really avoiding victim mentality.  Goggins  Stop complaining play the hand that you're dealt with right we're all dealt a certain hand and we all have various strengths and weaknesses.

5. Money management skills.  Websites: boggleheads or the subreddits for personal finance fat fire or wall street beds.

6. Learn another language

“You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.” ― Dr. Seuss

"Stop comparing yourself to others and just focus on yourself. So what if someone runs a mile in 5 minutes and it takes you 15? You both ran the same mile. You'll cross your finish line when you get there.  Run your own race. Not someone else's." - Heath Adams 9/10/20

"Don't fear failure. Embrace it." - Heath Adams

"Failure is inevitable." 

Rat race from Wikipedia: A rat race is an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit. The phrase equates humans to rats attempting to earn a reward such as cheese, in vain. It may also refer to a competitive struggle to get ahead financially or routinely.  The term is commonly associated with an exhausting, repetitive lifestyle that leaves no time for relaxation or enjoyment.

“Analyze your schedule, kill your empty habits, burn out the bullshit, and see what’s left.” – David Goggins

“The human body can withstand and accomplish a hell of a lot more than most of us think possible, and that it all begins and ends in the mind.” – David Goggins

“The Buddha famously said that life is suffering. I’m not a Buddhist, but I know what he meant and so do you. To exist in this world, we must contend with humiliation, broken dreams, sadness, and loss.” – David Goggins

“When you’re in hell, you forget how great you really are because you’re suffering and you forget the great things you’ve done.” – David Goggins

“I had a rough childhood coming up, and I just took all that negative energy and made it very positive for myself to drive me. I’m a very driven person. I have passion that almost scares people, just to be successful and make it no matter what.” – David Goggins

“It’s not about the cards you’re dealt, but how you play the hand.”―Randy Pausch

“The words you speak become the house you live in.” — Hafiz
We all have a story, and this is written by the words we use. If you tell yourself you’re anxious, you’re going to act accordingly. If you tell yourself you suck, it’s likely that you will. It is, therefore, crucial that you choose your words carefully, especially when you’re talking to yourself.
Words that stop you from taking action include “I can’t”, “if only”, and “I must”. These should be replaced with action words such as “I will”, “I choose to”, and “let’s look at this another way”.
In challenging situations, you should also track the questions you ask yourself. For instance, replacing “why me?” with “what can I do about this?” will instill a sense of strength, directing you towards corrective action, rather than blaming the world for your problems.

“Don’t fear failure. Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts, it is glorious even to fail.” — Bruce Lee
