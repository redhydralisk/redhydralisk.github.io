So many distractions nowadays.  Get a laser focus on your goals and necessary tasks to stay productive and make best use of your time.  Life is short.

Think of how far you are from the smart/wise people you know:
-Think hard about what you say/think/do.  There's a good chance it's wrong/not ideal.  But do your best.
-Be understanding of others who may seem to be not logical (like you).  Think of others who you're certain to have been patient with you.

Don't be surprised
Don't get angry - grasping hot coal with the intent to hurt someone else - you get burned.
Be calm - Thich Nhat Hanh
“When we walk like (we are rushing), we print anxiety and sorrow on the earth. We have to walk in a way that we only print peace and serenity on the earth... Be aware of the contact between your feet and the earth. Walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet.”  - Thich Nhat Hanh

Ruthless priortization - lots of good ideas.  have to say no to many of them to get to the great ideas.

Protect your time/attention.  Social media has AI to take your time/attention.  Step back and look at your life as an outside observer.

The highest level of mastery is simplicity.  Most information is irrelevant and most effort is wasted, but only the expert knws what to ignore.  James Clear

"Stop comparing yourself to others and just focus on yourself. So what if someone runs a mile in 5 minutes and it takes you 15? You both ran the same mile. You'll cross your finish line when you get there.  Run your own race. Not someone else's." - Heath Adams 9/10/20

Rat race from Wikipedia: A rat race is an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit. The phrase equates humans to rats attempting to earn a reward such as cheese, in vain. It may also refer to a competitive struggle to get ahead financially or routinely.  The term is commonly associated with an exhausting, repetitive lifestyle that leaves no time for relaxation or enjoyment.

“It’s not about the cards you’re dealt, but how you play the hand.”―Randy Pausch

“The words you speak become the house you live in.” — Hafiz
We all have a story, and this is written by the words we use. If you tell yourself you’re anxious, you’re going to act accordingly. If you tell yourself you suck, it’s likely that you will. It is, therefore, crucial that you choose your words carefully, especially when you’re talking to yourself.
Words that stop you from taking action include “I can’t”, “if only”, and “I must”. These should be replaced with action words such as “I will”, “I choose to”, and “let’s look at this another way”.
In challenging situations, you should also track the questions you ask yourself. For instance, replacing “why me?” with “what can I do about this?” will instill a sense of strength, directing you towards corrective action, rather than blaming the world for your problems.
